<h1>Wifi Authentication using blockchain: </h1>

<p> This is proof-of-concept system that checks a user's digital wallet for an NFT. If the user has the NFT, access to the WiFi network is granted.

This innovative approach addresses several security concerns with traditional methods of user authentication. By using blockchain technology, we can ensure that transactions are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. NFTs add an extra layer of security, as they are unique digital assets that cannot be replicated or duplicated.

Our project has the potential to be used in various settings, such as public WiFi hotspots or company networks. The benefits of this approach include enhanced security, streamlined authentication, and reduced risks of unauthorized access.

We are excited to present our project at this hackathon and demonstrate the potential of blockchain technology in WiFi authentication. <p>
